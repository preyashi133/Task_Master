Add a Task: Add a new task to your to-do list.
Remove a Task: Remove a task from the list once it's completed or no longer needed.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Modern UI: The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a clean and modern look.

* Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A modern, fast build tool for React projects.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
